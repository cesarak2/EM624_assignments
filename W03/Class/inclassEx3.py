# Exercise 00.2
# Sample progam

# This program read a txt file containing names
#    print the names and their frequencies and
#   the name with the highest frequency


# initializing the variable that will be used to hold the values to be printed
counter_dict = {}
num_max_freq = 0
name_max_freq = ''

# starting the loop on the lines of the input file
with open('names.txt') as in_file:  # opening the file
    line = in_file.readline()  # reading a line
    while line:
        line = line.strip()
        # strip() removes all whitespace at the start and end
        #  including spaces, tabs, newlines and carriage returns
        if line in counter_dict:  # checking if the name is already in the dictionary
            counter_dict[line] += 1  # if yes, adding 1 to the counter
            if counter_dict[line] >= num_max_freq:  # checking if current frequency is the max
                num_max_freq = counter_dict[line]
                name_max_freq = line
        else:
            counter_dict[line] = 1
        line = in_file.readline()  # reading the next line

# printing the results
print '\nThe following is the list of names in the file and their occurrences\n', counter_dict
print '\nThe name occourring the most is', name_max_freq, 'with', num_max_freq, 'occurrences'
